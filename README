Factory Method Pattern as referenced in my (Tentative) Design Pattern Collection Blog entry @ http://techrantnz.blogspot.com, that I'm slowly updating as my career progresses. I don't claim to know the best way to implement any given design pattern, so consider my code only as a guide to help when trying to understand a pattern/anti pattern or comparision of patterns for educational use.

This is all subject to change, should someone wish to fork it in github, add modify or even redo it entirely. 

Any advice/help or questions, direct them to me Dave van Dugteren @ dvd.nzl [AT] gmail.com or catch me on Twitter: DaveNZDeveloper
